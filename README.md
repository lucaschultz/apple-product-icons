### PSD Resources

This repository also includes all .psd (Photoshop) files for all icons. The files have been crafted carefully with (mostly) only vector shapes in use, so that they can be rescaled, if need be. Please keep in mind that the files are crafted to work right in 128px, so scaling the files will result in a loss of quality and detail.
  
## New products / Product enhancements

I will add new products to the repository as soon as possible, after they have been publicly announced by Apple Inc. If you like to add or change an icon to the set please feel free to fork this repository and send me a pull request.

## FAQ

__Are you working for Apple Inc.?__
No I am not. I do not have any past or present relationship with Apple Inc. But I truly love their products. :)

__Can I use these icons in commercial projects?__
Well, if you as me the answer would be yes. I release these icons publicly to be used in all kinds of projects. But please keep in mind that I do __not__ own any copyrights on any of the Apple products. Please make sure that you are allowed to use Apple products in your commercial projects, before using this set.

__Why do you also release the PSD files?__
For me this is a fun project. I am an Apple Fanboy for years and I wanted to recreate the current product lineup as 128px icons.

I am now also sharing the Photoshop files so that they can be used for learning purposes and help icon designers all over the world. Enjoy!

__How can I say thank you?__
You want to say thank you? Oh how nice of you! ;)
